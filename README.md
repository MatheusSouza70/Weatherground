<h1 align="center"> ☁️ How it works? ☁️</h1>
<p> - This project focuses on developing a responsive landing page where the user has a different visual experience at three different times and periods of the day.</p>

<h1 align="center"> ☁️ What was used? ☁️</h1>
<p> -  API Open Weather: https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/ </p>
<p> - Bootstrap 5: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/ </p>

<h1 align="center"> ☁️ How to use? ☁️</h1>
<p> - To use, just activate location usage in your browser. This makes it possible for the API to fetch data about where you live from their database and display the information.</p>
